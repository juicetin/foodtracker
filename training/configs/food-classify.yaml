# Food dish classification dataset config
# Used for Stage 3 of the detection pipeline: identify specific dish types
#
# Dataset structure (ImageNet-style for YOLO classification):
#   food-classification/
#     train/
#       pad-thai/
#       sushi/
#       hamburger/
#       ...
#     val/
#     test/
#     classes.txt
#
# nc and names are populated dynamically by merge_datasets.py
# based on the actual classes discovered across Food-101 + ISIA-500.
# After running merge_datasets.py, update this file with:
#   nc: <number from classes.txt>
#   names: <list from classes.txt>

path: ../datasets/food-classification
train: train
val: val
test: test
# nc: <populated after merge -- see classes.txt for count>
# names: <populated after merge -- see classes.txt for list>
