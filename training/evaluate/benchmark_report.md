# Benchmark Report: YOLO Pipeline vs VLM Food Detection

**Generated:** 2026-02-13 04:17:15 UTC
**Test set:** synthetic (50 generated images) (50 images)
**YOLO available:** No (models not yet trained)
**VLM model:** Not available

## Notes

- Test images are synthetic (colored rectangles). Real benchmark accuracy requires downloading datasets first: `python training/datasets/scripts/download_datasets.py`
- Could not load any VLM model (PaliGemma 2 3B, PaliGemma 2 1B, or Florence-2). This may be due to: missing HuggingFace authentication, insufficient memory, or network issues downloading model weights. To authenticate: `huggingface-cli login` with a token that has access to gated models.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Metric | YOLO Pipeline | VLM (N/A) |
|---|---|---|
| Overall Approx mAP@0.5 | N/A | N/A |
| Precision | N/A | N/A |
| Recall | N/A | N/A |
| F1 Score | N/A | N/A |
| Avg Latency | N/A | N/A |
| P95 Latency | N/A | N/A |
| Total Model Size | 0.0 MB | 0 MB |
| Deterministic | Yes | No |
| On-device Feasible | Yes | Marginal |

## Per-Cuisine Breakdown

| Cuisine | YOLO F1 | VLM F1 | YOLO Images | VLM Images |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chinese | N/A | N/A | 6 | 6 |
| Japanese | N/A | N/A | 8 | 8 |
| Korean | N/A | N/A | 6 | 6 |
| Thai | N/A | N/A | 6 | 6 |
| Vietnamese | N/A | N/A | 6 | 6 |
| Western | N/A | N/A | 8 | 8 |
| non-food | N/A | N/A | 10 | 10 |

## Hybrid Routing Analysis

Strategy: Use YOLO as primary detector. When YOLO max confidence < threshold,
fall back to VLM for a second opinion.

*Hybrid analysis requires both YOLO and VLM results. Skipped.*

## Latency Breakdown

## Go/No-Go Decision Data

Per locked decision DET-07: "If YOLO hits 85% but LLM hits 97%, invest more in YOLO training first."

| Factor | Value | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| YOLO accuracy | Not yet available (training in progress) | Pending 01-03 |
| VLM accuracy | Not available | Could not load model |

### Recommendation

**Status: Benchmark infrastructure ready, awaiting models.**
- YOLO models: Complete Plan 01-03 (YOLO training) first
- VLM models: Requires downloading PaliGemma/Florence-2 from HuggingFace
- Re-run this benchmark after models are available: `python training/benchmark.py`
